In this repository you will find some basic algorithms made in PHP. When I started to get deeper into programming, I realized that I should start my studies in programming logic. To acquire a good logic, I was instructed through a course that I took in the beginning of the year 2023, to use the PHP language to learn how to structure a good logic. In fact, the PHP language helped me a lot in this regard! Through this language I began to better understand several basic concepts of programming and how to use them in a practical way. 

It is important to make it clear that after a while I ended up not continuing my studies with PHP, so it was only used for a great logic learning. Until the moment I edit this repository I don't use PHP anymore.
